# Blood-Donation-Prediction

## Project Description :
Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers. In this Project, we will work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Centre. The dataset, obtained from the Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors. Our task will be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window. We will look at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to using the tpot library to automate your Machine Learning pipeline.

## Steps :
Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year".

Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

The data is stored in datasets/transfusion.data and it is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM). We'll explore what that means later in this notebook. First, let's inspect the data.
